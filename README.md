## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

On this project I have tried to utilize the clamp property to make responsive texts, margins and paddings. Though I still have a lot to learn to maximize the use of clamp. Additionally, on this project I started to practice the navbar and burger menu icon.


### Continued development

Needs further study on using clamp on css and maximize its use. Additionally I feel my coding in css needs further refactoring, going to look on refactoring my codes. 

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9VF-4euyRo&t=244s) - This the youtube of Kevin Powell discussing the basics of clamp to be used in responsive layouts.

## Acknowledgments

The courses I have undergone in Udemy with Dr. Angela is helping me a lot. Had couple of notes during that bootcamp and I'm now they are helping a lot since I can't remember most of the syntaxes.
